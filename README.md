# Interstellcats

Well, my last projects (Bob_ and Mila_) failed, so I want to present: Interstellcats!
It should be a game about spaceships and cats. (something like Freelancer or Elite Dangerous, but 2D and with cats)

# Game "rules"
[coming soon]

If You want to help me develop Interstellcats or you found a bug, please write me at interstellcatsDEV@gmail.com.
